# RefactoringKatas

This is a Refactoring Kata, based in [the Mini Pricer Kata](https://ingdevfi.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/kata-finance-le-minipricer/)

I developped the code with code smells and many dependencies to have a more representative real life code.

The Mini pricer currently compute the future price, based in a fixed volatility.
You have to refactor the code and to be able to compute-it with the classic method and also with random factor (+, - or 0).
